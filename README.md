Synopsis

Portfolio exercise. Responsive website. First page has a youtube video as background ( made by myself with a Go Pro Cam ). A timed button shows after 3 seconds allowing users to reach the material design inspired grid. The content is bold and intentional. The design allows for a clear navigation. The user knows where the information is contained. The second page has a contact me widget with alert.

Motivation

I wanted to start working on a new portfolio to show my knowledge. I wanted to experience with design and some JS. I love design with it is simple and accessible.
